You need 2 things in order to play or use these game variants and mods:
1. You must have TripleA 1.6.1 or later installed, as the games will only appear in the menu for this version or later versions.
2. You must have the map "World War II Classic" installed already. This is because all the mods in this pack use the art and files from this folder (they all point to this folder).

Without both of the above, you will not be able to use these mods.

Enjoy!
